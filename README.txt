Childtheme for TwentyTwelve. It utilizes the Theme Customizer, allows the use of custom colors, includes Infinite scroll and code for Subscribe2.

== Description ==

This theme was built for my personal use and utilizes the theme customizer. It allows for colorizing many aspects of the theme. It is designed to be a clean and simple theme. It also utilizes the [genericon font](http://genericons.com) found in the twentythirteen theme. I have included infinite scroll in which no extra plugin is required. Also I have added support for subscribe2. If you add the plugin, and create a page with the subscribe2 code, a custom floating dock is placed at the bottom right of the screen for subscribers, much like the wordpress plugin.
